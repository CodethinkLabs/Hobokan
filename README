This is Codethink's Kanban solution
-----------------------------------

It's built mainly using Ruby, Rails and Hobo. There's some JavaScript and jQuery too, and you can see from the history that we started by working with a couple of existing kanban implementations:
http://www.simple-kanban.com/ and https://github.com/dynamix/kanban

Getting Hobokan running on Ubuntu (tested on 12.04)
===================================================

These steps work for "Unbuntu" user... ymmv:

    echo "gem: --no-rdoc --no-ri" > ~/.gemrc

Install build-essential, git, curl, ruby, rvm etc:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential curl git-core
    sudo apt-get install openssl libreadline6 libreadline6-dev zlib1g zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt-dev autoconf libc6-dev ncurses-dev automake libtool bison subversion
    curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby

    source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm

    git clone https://github.com/devcurmudgeon/Hobokan.git
    cd Hobokan
    bundle install

    export RAILS_ENV="production"
    export DOMAIN="your.server.domain"
    export SECRET_TOKEN="a.random.string.of.at.least.30.chars"

Edit config/environments/production.rb:
- set "config.serve_static_assets = true"
- set up credentials for smtp :address, :username, :password

    rake db:migrate
    rails server


Getting Hobokan running on Heroku
=================================
The software is configured to run on Heroku - you'll need an account, keys, git etc, plus the Sendgrid and SSL add-ons.

To create a new instance on Heroku, you'll need to do something like the following steps to create an initial database -
$ bundle install
$ bundle rake db:migrate

$ heroku create  #will return a name, say blue-sky-1234
$ heroku rename --app blue-sky-1234 xx-kanban
$ git push git@heroku.com:xx-kanban.git
$ heroku db:push --app xx-kanban
$ heroku addons:add sendgrid:starter --app xx-kanban
$ heroku config:add DOMAIN=xx-kanban.heroku.com
$ heroku config:add SECRET_TOKEN=a.random.alphanumeric.string.of.at.least.30.chars

It should now be possible to create first admin user on the heroku instance, then invite users, create projects etc

TODO
====
Lots... we've been dogfooding this at Codethink for months, but there's plenty of room for improvement.

We're liberating the code to make it available for FLOSS projects, which means *at least* we'll need to provide public views of the kanban boards themselves, but will also lead to new requirements: as far as we know, using the kanban approach for FLOSS projects is new territory.
