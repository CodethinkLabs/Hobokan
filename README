This is Codethink's Kanban solution
-----------------------------------

It's built mainly using Ruby, Rails and Hobo. There's some JavaScript and jQuery too, and you can see from the history that we started by working with a couple of existing kanban implementations:
http://www.simple-kanban.com/ and https://github.com/dynamix/kanban

Getting Started
===============
The software is configured to run on Heroku - you'll need an account, keys, git etc, plus the Sendgrid and SSL add-ons. 

To create a new instance on Heroku, you'll need to do something like the following steps to create an initial database - either clone your repo into a new place, or delete your development.sqlite3
$ rm app/db/migrate/*
$ rails generate hobo:migration
$ rails generate vestal_versions:migration
$ rake db:migrate

$ heroku create  #will return a name, say blue-sky-1234
$ heroku rename --app blue-sky-1234 xx-kanban
$ git push git@heroku.com:xx-kanban.git
$ heroku db:push --app xx-kanban
$ heroku addons:add sendgrid:starter --app xx-kanban
$ heroku config:add DOMAIN=xx-kanban.heroku.com

It should now be possible to create first admin user on the heroku instance, then invite users, create projects etc

TODO
====
Lots... we've been dogfooding this at Codethink for months, but there's plenty of room for improvement. 

We're liberating the code to make it available for FLOSS projects, which means *at least* we'll need to provide public views of the kanban boards themselves, but will also lead to new requirements: as far as we know, using the kanban approach for FLOSS projects is new territory.
